```
:::

## Configuration

:::info
Note that you'll need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) installed on your system to run this command, as it uses `uvx`.
:::

  1. Run the `configure` command:
  ```sh
  goose configure
  ```

  2. Choose to add a `Command-line Extension`
  ```sh
    ┌   goose-configure

    │  Add Extension 
    │
    ◆  What type of extension would you like to add?
    │  ○ Built-in Extension 
    // highlight-start    
    │  ● Command-line Extension (Run a local command or script)
    // highlight-end    
    │  ○ Remote Extension 
    └ 
  ```

  3. Give your extension a name
  ```sh
    ┌   goose-configure 
    │

    ◇  What type of extension would you like to add?
    │  Command-line Extension 
    │
    // highlight-start
    ◆  What would you like to call this extension?
    │  tavily
    // highlight-end
    └ 
  ```

  4. Enter the command
  ```sh
    ┌   goose-configure 
    │

1. Real-time web search
2. Structured data extraction
3. Content analysis
4. Topic-specific search

### Goose Prompt

```
Search for recent news about artificial intelligence breakthroughs in medicine and summarize the key findings.
```

### Goose Output

```
I'll use the Tavily news search tool to find recent news about AI breakthroughs in medicine.

Let me summarize the key findings from the recent news about AI in medicine:

1. Personalized AI-Driven Healthcare:
- Development of AI systems that act as "personal doctors" that work alongside human clinicians rather than replacing them
- Focus on augmenting clinical capabilities while maintaining human oversight

2. Breakthrough in Medical Imaging:
- A significant advancement in CT scan analysis has been reported in Nature
- Development of a "Unified total-body CT image" (Uni-CT) algorithm that:
  - Automatically generates single series of total-body CT images
  - Concatenates multiple images of segmented organs using organ-specific window settings
  - Reduces diagnosis time by 35% without compromising accuracy
  - Improves efficiency in trauma cases

3. Future Trends:
- Movement toward democratized AI in healthcare, potentially reducing the gap between large and small healthcare providers
- Development of hyper-personalized medical experiences powered by AI
- Integration of AI systems that can perform human-like reasoning in medical contexts

The most concrete breakthrough appears to be in medical imaging, with the Uni-CT algorithm showing promising results in improving both the speed and accuracy of trauma diagnosis. This represents a practical application of AI that could have immediate benefits in emergency medicine.

Would you like me to search for more specific information about any of these developments or explore other areas of AI in medicine?
