Goose isn’t just useful on your local machine, it can also streamline tasks in CI/CD environments. By integrating Goose into your pipeline, you can automate tasks such as:

- Code reviews
- Documentation checks
- Build and deployment workflows
- Infrastructure and environment management
- Rollbacks and recovery processes
- Intelligent test execution

This guide walks you through setting up Goose in your CI/CD pipeline, with a focus on using GitHub Actions for code reviews.


## Using Goose with GitHub Actions
You can run Goose directly within GitHub Actions. Follow these steps to set up your workflow.

                     The summary for each file should be brief and structured as:

   ```

:::

### 1. Create the Workflow File

Create a new file in your repository at `.github/workflows/goose.yml`. This will contain your GitHub Actions workflow.

### 2. Define the Workflow Triggers and Permissions

Configure the action such that it:

- Triggers the workflow when a pull request is opened, updated, reopened, or labeled
- Grants the necessary permissions for Goose to interact with the repository
- Configures environment variables for your chosen LLM provider

```yaml
name: Goose

on:
    pull_request:
        types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, labeled]

permissions:
    contents: write
    pull-requests: write
    issues: write

env:
   PROVIDER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.REPLACE_WITH_PROVIDER_API_KEY }}
   PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
```


### 3. Install and Configure Goose

To install and set up Goose in your workflow, add the following steps:

```yaml
steps:
    - name: Install Goose CLI
      run: |
          mkdir -p /home/runner/.local/bin
          curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh \
            | CONFIGURE=false INSTALL_PATH=/home/runner/.local/bin bash
          echo "/home/runner/.local/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

    - name: Configure Goose
      run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.config/goose
          cat <<EOF > ~/.config/goose/config.yaml
          GOOSE_PROVIDER: REPLACE_WITH_PROVIDER
          GOOSE_MODEL: REPLACE_WITH_MODEL
          keyring: false
          EOF
```

:::info Replacements
Replace `REPLACE_WITH_PROVIDER` and `REPLACE_WITH_MODEL` with your LLM provider and model names and add any other necessary configuration required.
:::

### 4. Gather PR Changes and Prepare Instructions

This step extracts pull request details and formats them into structured instructions for Goose.

```yaml
    - name: Create instructions for Goose
      run: |
          cat <<EOF > instructions.txt
          Create a summary of the changes provided. Don't provide any session or logging details.
          The summary for each file should be brief and structured as:
            <filename/path (wrapped in backticks)>
              - dot points of changes
          You don't need any extensions, don't mention extensions at all.
          The changes to summarise are:
          $(cat changes.txt)
          EOF
```

### 5. Run Goose and Clean Output

Now, run Goose with the formatted instructions and clean the output by removing ANSI color codes and unnecessary log messages.

```yaml
    - name: Run Goose and filter output
      run: |
          goose run --instructions instructions.txt | \
            # Remove ANSI color codes
            sed -E 's/\x1B\[[0-9;]*[mK]//g' | \
            # Remove session/logging lines
            grep -v "logging to /home/runner/.config/goose/sessions/" | \
            grep -v "^starting session" | \
            grep -v "^Closing session" | \
            # Trim trailing whitespace
            sed 's/[[:space:]]*$//' \
            > pr_comment.txt
```

### 6. Post Comment to PR

Finally, post the Goose output as a comment on the pull request:

```yaml
    - name: Post comment to PR
      run: |
          cat -A pr_comment.txt
          gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body-file pr_comment.txt
```

With this workflow, Goose will run on pull requests, analyze the changes, and post a summary as a comment on the PR.

This is just one example of what's possible. Feel free to modify your GitHub Action to meet your needs.

## Security Considerations

When running Goose in a CI/CD enviroment, keep these security practices in mind:

1. **Secret Management**
      - Store your sensitive credentials (like API keys) as GitHub Secrets. 
      - Never expose these credentials in logs or PR comments.

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**
      - Grant only the necessary permissions in your workflow and regularly audit them.

3. **Input Validation**
      - Ensure any inputs passed to Goose are sanitized and validated to prevent unexpected behavior.
